# SkaTALTheory
An app for fast&amp;easy exam cheating through earpiece
This app offers an easy and reliable way to cheat on your school's tests - no matter what subject gets in your way, with minimal set-up, you'll ensure your success!
# Most effective with a micro earphone or stealthy bluetooth earphone, but can support any Android compatible audio device
# With the help of the TTS service, SkaTAL Theory reads your theory answer without errors and interruptions.
# Uses text files with the simplest markup system (described in the appendix) to divide the pronounced information into separate tasks, and each task into different variants.
# Each option can be signed with both a number and a keyword (in case of shuffling tickets by the teacher), which will be spoken by the application. Using the volume change button, you can select this option, and it will be played immediately
# The volume button works even when the phone is off, allowing you to discreetly select the necessary answer
# NEW! Enjoy pre-recorded audio recordings combined with timecode tables of contents! When manually entering the theory, this drastically reduces the time and labor intensity of preparation.
